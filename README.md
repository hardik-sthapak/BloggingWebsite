## Website Pages
* ### Home Page 
  The home page gives the information of the brand Blosome and what’s it all about.
  In this page I have used lots of html tags which includes “div” tags to divide and classify things for further styling in CSS. 
  The list tags were used for navigation panel. Images are included using “img” tags. And for coloring, font and styling, CSS and Bootstrap is used.

* ### Blogwall
  The blogwall page consists of all the popular blogs posted by the users.
  In this page the images and icons are taken from cdn of the frameworks fontawesome. The links are inserted using the anchor tags “a” tags.
  For writing quotes “blockquote” tags are used. For entering into a blog “button” tags are used and their styling is done in CSS.
  
* ### Blog Page
  The blog page consists of the blog written by the users. The blog page will contain all the blogs of a particular user.
  In this border is given to a particular div using CSS. For the introductory part a border left css property and padding to the left is done using CSS.
  For separation between the posts “hr” element is used and its styling is done using CSS and Bootstrap.
  
* ### Sign Up & Login Page
  The sign-up page is for registration of a user so they can write and share their own blogs on their walls.
  And the login page is for the users who already have their accounts on the Blosome.
  The registration part is done using the “form” tag and different attributes are used in “input” tag for different data field like username, email, checkbox etc.
